Subject: [PATCH 123/137] netfilter: add a member called port_forwarding_external_starting_port in struct nf_nat_range

Linux kernel 2.6.31 support new port forwarding function following spec 2.0

Modified for adding the new feature of port forwarding in spec 2.0.
Support transforming port range to another port range.

Solution: When nat port transforming,make port correspond one by one.
Adding min match port into target struct, then the increase number
can be calculated when nat port transforming.

DNI Common Module Patch Review Checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some basic things that I (Jonathan Chang) have checked
in order to ensure the quality of common modules.

1: The syntax and comment are compliant.

2: No memory leak.
   * memory allocated by malloc() will be freed
   * memory allocated by calloc() will be freed

3: No deadlock such as
   * No function call deadlock.
   * No semaphore deadlock.
   * No tag or label deadlock.

4: No stack overflow caused by
   * infinite recursion
   * too large local array variables

5: coding completeness, such as
   * conditions completeness
   * functions completeness
   * update completeness
   * memory resources completeness
   * sessions resources completeness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
