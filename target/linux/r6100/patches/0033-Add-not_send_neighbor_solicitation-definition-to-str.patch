Subject: [PATCH 033/137] Add "not_send_neighbor_solicitation" definition to struct neigh_parms

DNI Common Module Patch Review Checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some basic things that I (Jonathan Chang) have checked
in order to ensure the quality of common modules.

1: The syntax and comment are compliant.

2: No memory leak.
   * memory allocated by malloc() will be freed
   * memory allocated by calloc() will be freed

3: No deadlock such as
   * No function call deadlock.
   * No semaphore deadlock.
   * No tag or label deadlock.

4: No stack overflow caused by
   * infinite recursion
   * too large local array variables

5: coding completeness, such as
   * conditions completeness
   * functions completeness
   * update completeness
   * memory resources completeness
   * sessions resources completeness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
